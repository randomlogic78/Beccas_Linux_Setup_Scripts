# Becca's Linux Setup Scripts

This repository will host my dotfiles, and setup scripts for a fresh install of Linux Mint (should work on any Ubuntu variant). The README file will maintain the directions for using the scripts, and dotfiles will be placed in the dotfiles directory. It is important to note that I am a zsh user, and some dotfiles will not work unless you move to the zsh shell (which you should because, well, oh_my_zsh >^_^<).
